I am Team Lead for Short-Term Forecasting at the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA)](https://cdc.gov/cfa) within the [U.S. CDC](https://cdc.gov). My team develops and evaluates quantitative models of infectious disease dynamics. Much of our work is public and open-source. You can find our projects on GitHub within the [CDCGov](https://github.com/cdcgov/) organization.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu/) in the lab of [Jamie Lloyd-Smith](https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/lloydsmith/). I obtained my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu), where I was advised by [Simon A. Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/).
