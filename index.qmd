I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UCLA in the lab of [Jamie Lloyd-Smith](https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/lloydsmith/), where I use mathematical models to study virus ecology and evolution. I investigate how the dynamics of virus transmission and host immune responses shape virus evolution. What constrains or facilitates the emergence of zoonotic diseases via cross-species transmission? What forces govern virus antigenic evolution?

Additional research interests include developing Bayesian statistical and computational methods for quantitative virology, immunology, and population biology and understanding the mechanisms by which host environment (temperature, humidity, ventilation, etc) affect virus transmission. 

I obtained my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University, where I was advised by [Simon A. Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/).
